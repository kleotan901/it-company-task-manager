# It-Company Task Manager

The Task Manager is a powerful tool designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing tasks and handling problems during product development within a team. It provides a centralized platform where team members can create, assign, and track tasks, ensuring efficient collaboration and effective project management.

With the Task Manager, team members can easily create new tasks, providing essential details such as task name, description, deadline, priority, and assignees. 

The Update Task form allows team members to assign tasks to appropriate individuals, ensuring that the right person is responsible for the task's completion. This feature promotes transparency, collaboration, and effective task distribution within the team.

As tasks progress, team members can update the task status, indicating whether it's in progress, completed, or overdue. By marking tasks as done, team members can easily track progress and ensure timely completion of tasks, enhancing overall productivity and meeting project deadlines.
